<div class="para1">ITE offers close to 100 courses at three state-of-the-art Colleges. These courses are grouped in career clusters – Applied & Health Sciences, Business & Services, Design & Media, Electronics & InfoComm Technology, Engineering and Hospitality. Our industry recognised certificates in these skill areas have helped graduates and adult learners enjoy better job prospects and career progression.
               Besides Nitec and Higher Nitec level courses, we also offer Diploma level courses. We now have three Technical Diploma courses offered in partnership with prestigious overseas institutions, and 24 ITE Work-Study Diplomas jointly developed and conducted by our industry partners and ITE.
               To provide more pathways and wider choices for skills progression, we have increased the spectrum of Higher Nitec courses and the number of Traineeship courses. We have also made it possible for those who demonstrate interest and aptitude to join a course, through our Early Admissions Exercise. We have done all this so new students and ITE graduates alike can look forward to upgrading their skills, regardless of learning styles.

<article class="para3">
                ITE's passion for the environment resonates in the architecture of our Headquarters and Colleges.  They incorporated best practices in environmental design and construction, and adopted green building technologies meeting the BCA Green Mark Platinum standard.  Lush greenery, green wall, rooftop gardens, solar farms are but a few of the many green features that can be found in the Colleges.  As at 2018, all the ITE's campuses and Headquarters were certified Green Mark Platinum. ITE adopts the ISO14001 Environmental Management System.
                As an education institution, ITE plays a very important role in educating our youths to be conscious of environmental issues such as climate change, global warming, rising sea levels and food sustainability.  We take active steps to be an environmentally responsible organisation as well as engaging our students in environmental projects, outreach programmes and activities in partnership with the community.
